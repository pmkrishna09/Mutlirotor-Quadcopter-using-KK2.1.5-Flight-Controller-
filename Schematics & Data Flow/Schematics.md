## Schematics Explanation
In the circuit diagram, the Splitter cable is connected to the Power Distribution Board (PDB) where one end wires of the Electronic speed controllers (ESCs) are
connected to the Power Distribution Board (PDB) and another wires are connected to the motors.

And for real-time monitoring and controlling of a drone are connected with KK2.1.5 Flight Controller. This overall setup to the Power Dristribtion Board (PDB) 
which is used for constant power supply for all components and it is connected to the LiPo Battery.
