## 🚁 **WORKING OF THE SYSTEM** 👩🏻‍💻📓✍🏻💡

The system is divided into two primary components:  
- **Transmitter Unit (Ground-based)**  
- **Receiver Unit (Drone-based)**

### 🎮 **1. Transmitter Unit – FLYSKY FS-i6 Controller**

The **FLYSKY FS-i6** is a 6-channel 2.4GHz RF transmitter used to send flight commands to the drone.  
Each **channel** controls a specific function:

| Channel | Function                         | Description                                |
|---------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| CH1     | Aileron                          | Controls roll (left/right tilt)            |
| CH2     | Elevator                         | Controls pitch (forward/backward tilt)     |
| CH3     | Throttle                         | Controls altitude (up/down)                |
| CH4     | Rudder                           | Controls yaw (left/right rotation)         |
| CH5     | Auxiliary                        | Used for flaps, gear, or custom input      |
| CH6     | Flight Mode / Gyro / Aux Toggle | Used to switch between flight modes        |

The controller converts joystick movements into **PPM/PWM signals**, which are transmitted as **2.4GHz radio frequency signals** to the drone.

### 📡 **2. Receiver Unit – Onboard Drone Components**

The **receiver system** includes:

- **FLYSKY FS-iA6B** 2.4GHz receiver  
- **KK2.1.5 Flight Controller**  
- **BLDC Motors**  
- **Electronic Speed Controllers (ESCs)**  
- **Power Distribution Board (PDB)**

These components receive signals from the transmitter and act to control the drone's motion in real time.

---

## 🔄 **Detailed Working and Data Flow**

The drone system functions through the following structured steps:

---

### 🧭 **Step 1: User Input (Transmitter Side)**  
- Pilot moves control sticks on **FS-i6** to generate flight commands.  
- Transmitter encodes stick positions into **PPM/PWM signals**.  
- These signals are transmitted wirelessly as **2.4GHz RF** to the receiver on the drone.

---

### 📶 **Step 2: Signal Reception (Receiver Side)**  
- The **FS-iA6B Receiver** receives the RF signal.  
- It decodes the data into corresponding **channel signals**.  
- Signals are passed to the **KK2.1.5 flight controller** via wired connections.

---

### 🧠 **Step 3: Flight Controller Processing**  
- The **KK2.1.5** processes the input signals to determine intended movement.  
- It references onboard **gyroscope and accelerometer** data to assess orientation.  
- The controller calculates **PWM outputs** needed to maintain balance and direction.  
- Real-time corrections are made for stability (pitch, roll, yaw).

---

### ⚙️ **Step 4: Signal Transmission to ESCs**  
- PWM signals are sent from the flight controller to **Electronic Speed Controllers (ESCs)**.  
- ESCs regulate the power delivered to each **Brushless DC Motor**.  
- Motor speeds adjust dynamically based on command inputs.

---

### 🌀 **Step 5: Execution of Drone Movement**  
| Command         | Result                    |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| Throttle Up     | Drone Ascends             |
| Throttle Down   | Drone Descends            |
| Roll Left/Right | Drone Tilts Left/Right    |
| Pitch Forward/Backward | Drone Moves Forward/Backward |
| Yaw Left/Right  | Drone Rotates Left/Right  |

The coordinated RPM variation of motors enables precise flight control and directional navigation.

---

### 🔄 **Step 6: Continuous Feedback and Adjustment**  
- The **flight controller** continuously collects motion data from onboard sensors.  
- It detects any **external interference** (e.g., wind gusts or sudden shifts).  
- Automatic adjustments are made by recalculating PWM values.  
- This loop ensures **stable, responsive, and smooth flight** performance.

##  System Analysis of the Drone 📊📋
• **Communication:** The RF system enables bidirectional communication between the 
drone and the controller. Commands like flight direction, speed, altitude, and 
camera operation are sent via RF signals. 

• **Control Range:** RF systems determine the maximum distance at which the drone 
can be controlled. This range varies based on the power of the RF system and 
environmental conditions. 

• **Real-time Feedback:** RF systems provide real-time feedback from the drone to the 
operator, including video feed, telemetry data, and battery status.  

• **Complexity of Operation:** Operating RF drone systems may require technical 
expertise, especially in understanding frequency management, signal propagation, 
and troubleshooting interference issues. 

• **Susceptibility to Environmental Factors:** Environmental conditions such as rain, 
fog, and wind can affect RF signal strength and stability, potentially disrupting drone 
operations.
