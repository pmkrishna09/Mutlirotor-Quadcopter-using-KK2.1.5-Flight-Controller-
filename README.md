## Working 👩🏻‍💻📓✍🏻💡
**WORKING OF THE SYSTEM** 

The system consists of two main units: the transmitter unit, and the receiver unit, 
which is mounted on the drone. The transmitter unit consists of a controller which is 
FLYSKY FS-i6 6-channel 2.4GHz transmitter includes  
Channels 1-4 (Main Controls): 
Channel 1: Ailerons (roll control)  
Channel 2: Elevator (pitch control)  
Channel 3: Throttle (power control)  
Channel 4: Rudder (yaw control)  
 
Channels 5-6 (Auxiliary Functions): 
Channel 5: Often used for flaps or gear, depending on the model setup.  
Channel 6: Can be used for flight modes, gyro gain, or other functions.   
while the receiver unit on the drone comprises an Flight Controller KK2.1.5, a FLYSKY FS
iA6 2.4GHz receiver, BLDC motors, Electronic Speed Controllers (ESCs), and a power 
distribution board. 
 
**Detailed Working of the Drone System and Data Flow** 
The drone system operates based on real-time communication between the transmitter 
(controller) and the receiver onboard the drone. Commands given by the pilot are 
processed through a structured data flow, enabling precise control over the drone’s 
movement.  
How Commands Are Recognized and Processed 
**1. User Input (Transmitter Side)** 
• The pilot moves the control sticks on the FLYSKY FS-i6 transmitter to issue 
movement commands. 
• The transmitter converts the stick positions into PPM/PWM signals and encodes 
them for transmission. 
• A 2.4GHz RF signal is sent wirelessly from the transmitter to the drone’s receiver.

**2. Signal Reception (Drone Receiver Side)** 
• The FLYSKY FS-iA6B receiver on the drone receives the 2.4GHz RF signal. 
• It decodes the PPM/PWM signals and forwards them to the KK2.1.5 flight 
controller through individual channel outputs.

**3. Flight Controller Processing** 
• The KK2.1.5 flight controller processes the received signals, analyzing the 
required movement based on user input. 
• The gyroscope and accelerometer measure real-time orientation and flight 
conditions. 
• The flight controller calculates the necessary PWM adjustments for each motor to 
execute the desired motion. 
• Corrective actions are applied in real time to maintain stability and control.
 
**4. Signal Transmission to ESCs** 
• The KK2.1.5 sends specific PWM signals to the Electronic Speed Controllers 
(ESCs). 
• The ESCs regulate the power delivered to each BLDC motor, adjusting their speed 
accordingly.

**5. Execution of Drone Movement** 
• The BLDC motors respond by spinning at varying speeds, generating the required 
thrust and directional control. 
• The drone moves according to the pilot’s commands:  
o Throttle Up → Drone Ascends 
o Throttle Down → Drone Descends 
o Roll Left/Right → Drone Tilts Left/Right 
o Pitch Forward/Backward → Drone Moves Forward/Backward 
o Yaw Left/Right → Drone Rotates Left/Right

**6. Continuous Feedback and Adjustment** 
• The flight controller continuously monitors stability using its onboard 
gyroscope and accelerometer. 
• If external disturbances affect flight, the controller compensates by adjusting 
motor speeds automatically. 
• This ensures a smooth, stable, and responsive flying experience.

##  System Analysis of the Drone 📊📋
• **Communication:** The RF system enables bidirectional communication between the 
drone and the controller. Commands like flight direction, speed, altitude, and 
camera operation are sent via RF signals. 

• **Control Range:** RF systems determine the maximum distance at which the drone 
can be controlled. This range varies based on the power of the RF system and 
environmental conditions. 

• **Real-time Feedback:** RF systems provide real-time feedback from the drone to the 
operator, including video feed, telemetry data, and battery status.  

• **Complexity of Operation:** Operating RF drone systems may require technical 
expertise, especially in understanding frequency management, signal propagation, 
and troubleshooting interference issues. 

• **Susceptibility to Environmental Factors:** Environmental conditions such as rain, 
fog, and wind can affect RF signal strength and stability, potentially disrupting drone 
operations.
