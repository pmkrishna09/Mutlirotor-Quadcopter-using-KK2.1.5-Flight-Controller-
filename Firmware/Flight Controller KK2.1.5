#Flight Controller (KK2.1.5):
You can check the complete instruction manual of KK2.1.5 Flight Controller (https://dl.btc.pl/kamami_wa/hk_54299_7.pdf) with this link.   

Stabilization and balancing of the UAV is done by the flight controller. It continuously takes measurements from the sensors (IMU, barometer etc.) and makes the required adjustments to the speed of the 
rotors through the ESC to keep the body stable and carry out the required movement (pitch, yaw, roll). The flying capabilities consist of the following factors:

Gyro stabilization: The ability to keep the UAV stable and level.
Self-leveling: The ability to automatically adjust itself during any orientation so the UAV stays level.
Altitude Hold: The ability to hover at a certain altitude over the ground.

The KK2.1.5 was engineered from the ground up to bring multi-rotor flight to everyone, not just the experts. The LCD screen and built-in software makes install and setup easier than ever.
A host of multi-rotor craft types are pre-installed, simply select your craft type, check motor layout/propeller direction, calibrate your ESCs and radio and your are ready to go! All of which is done with
easy-to-follow on-screen prompts!
The original KK gyro system has been updated to an incredibly sensitive 6050 MPU system making this the most stable KK board ever and allowing for the addition of an auto-level function. 
At the heart of the KK2.1.5 is an Atmel Mega644PA 8-bit AVR RISC-based microcontroller with 64k of memory. An additional header has been added for voltage detection, so no need for on-board soldering.
A handy piezo buzzer is also included with the board for audio warning when activating and deactivating the board.
Its operating voltage is 1.8V to 5.5V and its input voltage is 4.8-6.0 V.

##*Flight Controller Setup*

For setting up KK2.1.5 board, first keep the transmitter on and ensure that the receiver is bound to transmitter. There are four buttons at the bottom of the KK2.1.5 board S1, S2, S3 and S4. 
Using these buttons, we will interact with LCD display.
Step-1 First go to menu by pressing S4 then go to load motor layout then select quad copter X mode and setup quad Copter at X – mode. Check all the motor directions here. 
Step-2 Next is ACC calibration, for which we have to place quad copter on the plane level surface and select the Acc Calibration that is to calibrate accelerometer. Click on S4, this is auto calibration.
  
As soon as Acc calibration over, we can pull out the power and provide the power again. It will be showing safe on LCD display which means, it has changed from error to safe.      
 
Step-3 Now, go to the PI editor. Here, we have to set P (gain / limit) and I (gain / limit) of aileron (Roll), elevator (Pitch) and rudder (Yaw). P gain is proportionality gain that represents sensitivity and 
responsibility. Higher P means sharper control and lower P means softer one.
 
I is integral gain that represents how well it holds the altitude. Once PI setting has been done go to the mode setting.
 
Step-4 In the mode setting, set the self level to AUX.
Step-5 Now go to miscellaneous settings, here we will set Alarm 1/10 volts.
 
To set alarm 1/10 volts, we need to do following calculations.
3-Cell LiPo battery of 11.1 volts use a value 3.60 volt per cell to denote an empty batter then set the value (in 1/10’s) to (3.6 * 3 * 10   = 108) and when the supply voltage drops to 10.8 volts the alarm 
will sound.
Step-6 Now, we fo the calibration of ESCs. First turn the transmitter with throttle to minimum then move throttle to maximum and keep pressing S1 and S4 switches and then connect the battery to the quad copter,
now we will get two beep sound and we will put the throttle down which leads to single beep sound. With this, the calibration process gets over.
Step-7 To arm the quad copters, keep the throttle at left hand side, once the quad copter is armed, we can fly quadcopter.
