# Transmitter and Receiver Module
Transmitter works as a controller for a user. User can operate quad copter using this transmitter only. It is based on radio communication. The receiver is attached on the drone, receiver has antenna and with the help of antenna, it communicates with the transmitter. This is a completely wireless communication. The transmitter transmits a signal to the receiver and the receiver sends that signal to the flight controller. We are using FLYSKY transmitter and receiver here. This transmitter has range of 1500 meter but if we are using this transmitter at a place where magnetic interference is high, then range of transmitter will be decrease. 
The FS-i6 is a digital proportional radio control system that operates on the global ISM band of 2.4GHz frequency, making it suitable usage across the globe. Further the transmitter is built on AFHDS 2A (Automatic Frequency Hopping Digital System Second Generation) technology, which not only makes the communication between you and your drone secure but also reduces the power consumption of your transmitter. These features along with the affordable price of this transmitter has made a go to choice for drone enthusiasts across the globe. The FLYSKY FS-i6 transmitter and FS-iA6B receiver comes with a lot of bells and whistles allowing you to fully customize your flight setting and use it from basic drones, airplanes, helicopters to complicated multi copters and racing drones. But, if you are a beginner you might probably be overwhelmed with all the buttons, toggle switches, joysticks and customization options on this transmitter module.

LCD Screen- The LCD screen is a user interface of this transmitter. We set up the transmitter by using the button by seeing at the LCD display. We can see the battery indicator, mode indicator, etc. on the LCD display. The battery indicator is used to indicate the power and status of the transmitter and receiver. A receiver's battery status will not be displayed if it is not bound to the transmitter.
Gimbals (Sticks)- This transmitter has two sticks, one is on the left side and another is on the right side. Using these gimbals, we can control four channels viz.
 Channel1- Ailerons (Roll), Channel2- Elevator (Pitch), Channel3- Throttle, and Channel4- Rudder (Yaw); these are the default channel settings for mode 2. We have further explained the mode. In the image given below, we can see that there are 2 gimbals in the image. One is on the right side and the other is on the left side.
Trims - We use trims for stabilizing the drone. We adjust these trims when the drone destabilizes during flight. These four trims are given for four channels. By holding the trim in the desired direction, we may perform faster trim adjustments. The transmitter starts beeping in a higher tone when the trim position reaches the middle.
VRA & VRB Knobs - These two knobs are given at the top of the transmitter. These are auxiliary channels that can be used to attach switches to extra channels to control parts of the model like landing gear and headlight. In the image given below, we can see that it has two knobs. The knob on the left is VRA and the knob on the right is VRB.
Switches- There are four switches given on top of this transmitter i.e, switch A (SWA), switch B (SWB), switch C (SWC), and switch D (SWD). A, B, D are two mode switches and C is a three mode switch. We can put the function of channel 5 and 6 in any one of the two-mode switches. We use switch C when we use GPS in drones.
Bind Key- We use bind-key when we bind the transmitter to the receiver. In the image given below, we can see the black-colored bind-key. This button is at the bottom of the left side of the transmitter.

This receiver has 2 antennas and 6 channels. For the best quality signal, the receiver should be mounted away from the motors or metal parts. The connectors are used to connect the parts of the model and the receiver.
 
CH1 to CH6: These channels are used to connect the ESCs (Electronic speed controller), Vcc, or other parts.
B/VCC: It is used to connect the binding cable for the binding receiver and transmitter.
